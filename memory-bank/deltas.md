# Recent Deltas (Last 3-5 Changes)

## 2026-08-04: Compact Oneline Output for tmux

- Added `--compact` for narrow status lines: percentages are rounded to integers, `(5h)` / `(7d)` labels and successful-status icons are omitted, while authentication/API errors remain visible.
- The tmux wrapper now defaults to `--claude --codex --oneline both --compact`, producing output such as `Claude: 3%/42% | Codex: 37%`.
- Added output and CLI regression tests and updated the README tmux defaults.

## 2026-07-24: Z.AI Peak/Off-Peak Quota-Rate Indicator

- **Feature**: Z.AI's peak window (14:00–18:00 UTC+8 = 06:00–10:00 UTC) and quota multiplier are computed **client-side** by `zai_quota_rate(now=None)` — no API endpoint exposes them. GLM-5.2/5-Turbo burn 3× quota at peak, 2× off-peak (promo: 1× through `ZAI_OFFPEAK_PROMO_END = 2026-09-30`; constant must be dropped/updated after that).
- **Display**: detailed view adds `Quota Rate: ⚡ 3x peak — ends in Xh Ym` / `1x (promo) off-peak — peak in Xh Ym`; oneline appends ` ⚡3x` (` 3x` in `--noemoji`) **during peak only**; JSON gains `zai.quota_rate = {peak, multiplier, changes_in}`.
- **Why**: user hit 429s at 1% token usage — those are dynamic concurrency limits (tightest at peak, per docs.z.ai usage-policy), invisible in the quota API. The indicator at least flags when the 3× / tight-concurrency window is active. Peak = China afternoon = 02:00–06:00 US Eastern, so overnight agent runs are the exposed ones.
- **Resets follow-up**: `--resets` in `both` mode now appends Z.AI's monthly MCP reset as the second countdown (`↻3h28m/5d10h`, matching the tokens%/mcp% pair); single-window modes unchanged (token reset only).
- **Tests**: 226 total (7 new) — `TestZaiQuotaRate` (peak/off-peak/promo-end/boundaries, test_usage.py); peak line + oneline marker presence/absence + both-mode dual reset (test_output.py).
- **Files**: `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_usage.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `README.md`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-07-24: Z.AI TIME_LIMIT Relabeled as Monthly MCP-Tools Quota

- **Problem**: the Z.AI `TIME_LIMIT` bucket (e.g. 650/4,000) was labeled "Request Quota" under the 5h header, implying it was the 5h prompt quota. Live API inspection shows it's actually the **monthly** quota for MCP tools — `usageDetails` lists only `search-prime`/`web-reader`/`zread`, and `nextResetTime` is ~month-end, not 5h. Confirmed by Z.AI dev-pack FAQ: Web Search/Reader have a separate monthly quota (100–4,000 by tier); only the token pool is the 5h window.
- **Fix**: JSON key `request_quota` → `mcp_quota`, now also carrying `resets_in` (`Nd Nh`) and a `tools` per-tool usage breakdown from `usageDetails`. Detailed view prints "MCP Tools (monthly):" with reset countdown and per-tool lines. Oneline `both` mode unchanged in shape (`tokens%/mcp%`).
- **Breaking (JSON consumers)**: any consumer reading `zai.request_quota` must switch to `zai.mcp_quota`.
- **Tests**: 219 total (updated in place) — parser assert in test_usage.py; label/breakdown asserts + `TestZaiOnelineBoth` renamed keys in test_output.py.
- **Files**: `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_usage.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-07-21: --resets Flag Adds Reset Countdowns to Oneline (v1.4.0)

- **Feature**: new `--resets` flag (alias `--timeremaining`) appends a compact `↻` reset countdown to each provider in `--oneline` output, e.g. `Claude: 4.0%/19.0% ✅ ↻2h15m/3d17h` (`both` mode shows `5h-reset/7d-reset`). Off by default — without the flag, output is byte-identical to before.
- **Coverage**: Claude + Codex (per-window `resets_in`), Z.AI (`token_quota.resets_in`), Synthetic (`rolling_5h.next_tick_in` / `weekly_credits.next_regen_in`), Gemini (per-tier `resets_in`), Antigravity (earliest reset across models — see below). OpenRouter/Kimi are prepaid balances with nothing to reset — unchanged.
- **Antigravity earliest reset**: new `_earliest_antigravity_reset(models)` picks the soonest parseable `resetTime` ISO string across models (skips empty/garbage); stored as `summary.next_reset_in` so it flows into JSON, the oneline `↻` suffix, and a new `Next reset:` line in the detailed view.
- **Bonus fix**: `format_reset_time` never rolled hours into days — Claude's weekly reset rendered as `89h 13m`; now `3d 17h` everywhere (detailed + oneline).
- **Plumbing**: all `render_oneline` renderers take a 4th `show_resets=False` param; shared `_reset_suffix(*resets)` helper compacts strings (`"2h 15m"` → `↻2h15m`, filters `N/A`/missing); `print_oneline` gained `show_resets` kwarg.
- **Tests**: 219 total (9 new) — `TestOnelineResets` (6 cases incl. Antigravity, test_output.py), CLI flag + alias (test_cli.py), `_earliest_antigravity_reset` + summary equality update (test_usage.py).
- **Files**: `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_usage.py`, `README.md`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`, `memory-bank/progress.md`

## 2026-07-16: Codex Windows Classified by Duration, Not Slot Position

- **Problem**: `get_codex_usage()` assumed `rate_limit.primary_window` = 5h and `secondary_window` = 7d by slot position. OpenAI does not guarantee that — weekly-only / reset accounts return a single window (often the **weekly** one) in the `primary_window` slot with `secondary_window: null` (see quotio#356, CodexBar). Result: `--oneline both` **dropped Codex entirely** (renderer required both slots filled) and the default view **mislabeled** the weekly number as `(5h)`.
- **Fix (parsing)**: iterate both raw windows and bucket each by its own `limit_window_seconds` — `<=86400` (≤24h) → session/5h bucket (`result["primary_window"]`), anything longer → weekly/7d bucket (`result["secondary_window"]`). Reset formatting follows the bucket (h/m vs d/h). Slot order no longer matters.
- **Fix (renderer)**: `_make_str_pct_renderer._r` now degrades gracefully — in `both` mode with only one window present it renders that single window; single-window modes fall back to the other window if the requested one is absent. A provider exposing only one window always shows up, correctly labeled `(5h)`/`(7d)`.
- **Effect**: Codex Pro account currently returns weekly-only → now shows `Codex: 6% (7d) ✅` in default, `both`, and `7d` modes (was: dropped in `both`, mislabeled `6% (5h)` in default). Claude/Plus accounts with both windows still render dual `X%/Y%`.
- **Tests**: 210 total (5 new) — `test_weekly_only_in_primary_slot`, `test_windows_classified_by_duration_not_slot` (test_usage.py); `TestOnelineSingleWindowDegradation` (3 cases, test_output.py)
- **Files**: `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_usage.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`, `memory-bank/progress.md`

## 2026-07-12: Stale-Cache Fallback for Transient API Errors

- When a live fetch fails with a transient error (connection error, HTTP 5xx, generic "API error" / "Could not fetch usage") but the cache holds a previous good entry for that provider, the stale entry is served with a visible age marker instead of ❌
- **Rationale**: extends the v1.2.15 cache-merge principle ("a run that CAN'T check a provider shouldn't destroy known-good data") to display time — a 30-minute-old quota reading is more useful in a statusline than an error icon from a momentary API blip
- **Qualification rules** (which failures trigger fallback):
  - Transient (served stale): connection errors (`http_get` status 0 → "API error (0)"/"HTTP 0"), HTTP 5xx, "API error", "Could not fetch usage", generic exceptions
  - NOT transient (error shown as-is): `No credentials found` (🔑 config issue), `Token expired`/`token_status: "expired"` (⏰ actionable), `Invalid API key`/`Forbidden`/`Authentication failed` (user must act), any error string containing "401" or "403"
- **Good cached entry**: `status` of `ok` or `authenticated` (same notion as `merge_cache_data` implies)
- **Staleness cap**: `STALE_CACHE_MAX_AGE = 24 * 60 * 60` (24h) — entries older than this are not served; the error is shown instead
- **Labeling**: substituted entries annotated with `stale_age_seconds` (int) and `stale_fallback = True` (bool); oneline renders `(stale 32m)` suffix (yellow in `--noemoji` color mode); detailed output prints `💤 Stale fallback (last good: 32m ago)`; JSON output carries both annotation fields for scripted consumers
- **Merge-rule extension**: `merge_cache_data` now also preserves prior good entries when the new run hits a transient error (not just `NO_CREDS_ERROR`). Decision: transient errors are akin to "can't check" — the API was temporarily unreachable — so the same preservation principle applies. This keeps the cache the best known data across multiple consecutive blips; without it, the first blip would poison the cache and subsequent stale fallbacks would have nothing to serve
- **Where it hooks in**: after live fetches complete in `main()`, before output. Reads the stale cache BEFORE `write_cache` (to preserve original age for the marker), writes the cache (extended merge preserves good entries), then applies `apply_stale_fallback(results, cached_data, cached_age)` to replace transient errors with annotated stale entries
- **`read_cache` extension**: added optional `max_age` parameter — when provided, TTL is ignored and entries up to `max_age` seconds old are returned (for stale fallback reads); when `None` (default), behaves exactly as before
- **Both modes covered**: plain runs (no `--cached`) and `--cached` runs whose TTL missed — a TTL miss followed by a failed fetch is the exact statusline scenario that motivated v1.2.15
- **Opt-out**: `--no-stale-fallback` flag disables the feature; default is ON
- **New functions**: `_is_transient_error(data)`, `_is_good_cache_entry(data)`, `apply_stale_fallback(results, cached_data, cached_age, max_age)`
- **Tests**: 205 total (42 new) — `_is_transient_error` classification (13 cases), `apply_stale_fallback` substitution (9 cases), `read_cache` max_age (3 cases), merge transient preservation (2 cases), oneline stale marker (4 cases), detailed stale line (2 cases), CLI integration (9 cases: transient→stale, JSON annotation, no-creds/expired/401 not replaced, >24h cap, `--no-stale-fallback`, `--cached` TTL miss, detailed output)

## 2026-07-12: Provider Registry Refactor

- Refactored per-provider duplication in `lib/cclimits.py` into a data-driven `PROVIDERS` registry (~93 lines saved, 2004 → 1911)
- **What was duplicated**: `print_oneline()` had 8 near-identical ~25-line provider blocks; `main()` had 8 hand-written argparse flags, 8 dispatch `if`-lines, 8 `print_section()` calls, and a hardcoded canonical-order tuple; argparse had 8 copy-pasted `--<provider>` flags
- **What the registry drives**: argparse flag creation, `requested` list, fetch dispatch (with gated/ungated credential semantics), canonical-order result collection, detailed `print_section` loop, and `print_oneline` iteration
- **Shared renderers**: `_fmt_both` (dual-window percent), `_fmt_single` (single-window percent with suffix), `_fmt_balance` (balance with threshold ladder) — Z.AI's integer percents / `request_quota` second value / `(5h)` suffix fallback and Synthetic's `weekly_credits.percent_used` handled via per-provider extractor lambdas, not by re-forking the renderer
- **Two renderer factories**: `_make_str_pct_renderer` (Claude/Codex string-based percents) and `_make_balance_renderer` (OpenRouter/Kimi balance with currency symbol)
- **Fail branch unified**: `fail_icon` (🔑 no-creds / ⏰ expired / ❌ error) applied in one place in the `print_oneline` loop, not per-provider
- **Test patching preserved**: fetch/credential functions stored as name strings, resolved via `globals()` at call time so `@patch('cclimits.get_X_usage')` still intercepts
- **Byte-identical output**: all 163 tests pass with zero assertion changes; live output diffs show only timestamp and real-time data differences
- **Extension point**: adding a provider now requires one `PROVIDERS` entry + one fetch function (+ a custom renderer if the shared factories don't fit) — no edits to `main()` or `print_oneline()` internals

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-07-12: GitHub Actions CI + Automated npm Publishing

- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: runs the 163-test pytest suite on push to main and pull requests across a Python 3.9/3.11/3.13 matrix with two HTTP-backend flavors — one with `requests` installed (full suite), one without (urllib fallback; `-k "not WithRequests"` skips the 9 tests that mock the requests library). Also runs a `node bin/cclimits.js --help` wrapper smoke test.
- Added `.github/workflows/publish.yml`: triggered by `v*` tags — runs the test suite, verifies the tag version matches `package.json`, then publishes to npm with `--access public` via Trusted Publishing (OIDC — npm's recommended CI/CD auth; no token secret, provenance automatic). Requires `id-token: write` permission and a Trusted Publisher configured on npmjs.com for the package.
- Added `requirements-dev.txt` (pytest, requests) for dev dependency tracking.
- Added CI status badge to `README.md`.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` Publishing Workflow section to document both automated (tag-push) and manual paths.

**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`, `memory-bank/activeContext.md`

## 2026-07-12: Parallel Provider Fetching via ThreadPoolExecutor

- `main()` now builds a list of (provider_name, fetch_callable) pairs using the same dispatch logic, then submits them to a `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` (max_workers = number of selected providers) so a full run takes ~max(provider_latencies) instead of sum(provider_latencies)
- Credential discovery for the four gated providers (openrouter, kimi, antigravity, synthetic) still runs before submission in the main thread, preserving the check_all-conditional-fetch semantics and the module-level patch pattern used by tests
- Results are collected in canonical provider order (claude, codex, gemini, zai, openrouter, kimi, antigravity, synthetic) by iterating `future.result()` in that order — deterministic `--json` key order and `--oneline` output preserved
- A provider whose worker raises an unexpected exception is captured as `{"error": "..."}` for that provider only; one bad provider can no longer blank out the statusline
- Zero new dependencies: `ThreadPoolExecutor` is stdlib (Python 3.2+, well within the 3.9+ floor)
- New tests in `TestParallelFetch`: canonical ordering with all 8 providers, exception isolation (one provider raises, others succeed), concurrency timing (two providers each sleeping 0.3s finish < 0.55s)
- Tests: 163 passing (3 new; all 160 existing pass unchanged)

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-07-12: Cache-Bypass Fix for Last Four Providers

- `main()` dispatch lines for openrouter, kimi, antigravity, and synthetic were missing the `not skip_fetch` guard that the first four providers already had; on a `--cached` cache hit these four still ran credential discovery + live HTTP fetches and overwrote cached entries, defeating the cache (Antigravity alone can make 2+ round-trips + a token refresh)
- Added `not skip_fetch and` to all four dispatch lines, matching the existing pattern for claude/codex/gemini/zai
- Regression tests added in `TestCachedBypassFix`: cache hit asserts zero calls to all 8 usage functions and 4 credential-discovery functions; cache miss verifies explicit-flag-forces-fetch and check_all-conditional-fetch semantics; `--openrouter --cached` missing-from-cache refetch path verified
- Tests: 155 passing (5 new)

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-07-02: Expired Tokens Visible in Oneline

- Expired OAuth tokens no longer silently vanish from `--oneline`: entries with `token_status: "expired"` (Gemini/Codex 401 paths return these with no `error` key) or `error: "Token expired"` (Claude) now render as ⏰ (`expired` in yellow with `--noemoji`)
- All 8 provider blocks broadened to catch `token_status == "expired"`; `fail_icon()` picks 🔑 / ⏰ / ❌
- Found via cache inspection: gemini entry was `{token_status: expired, hint_refresh: ...}` — neither ok nor error, so oneline dropped it entirely
- README: added status-icon legend and updated `both` examples (Z.AI `tokens%/requests%`)
- Tests: 155 passing (4 new; 2 stale assertions updated: `error: "Token expired"` now ⏰ not ❌)

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `README.md`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-07-02: Atomic Cache Writes + Z.AI Dual Value in Both Mode

- `write_cache()` writes to a `.json.tmp` sibling then `os.replace()` — concurrent runs (cron/statusline vs interactive) can no longer observe a half-written cache
- `--oneline both` now shows Z.AI as `tokens%/requests%` (e.g. `Z.AI: 1%/0%`), matching the dual-value style of Claude/Codex/Synthetic; falls back to `N% (5h)` when request quota is absent; `5h`/`7d` windows unchanged
- Tests: 151 passing (4 new)

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `tests/test_utils.py`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-07-02: Cache Filter/Staleness + Z.AI Data Fixes

- Provider filters now honored on cache hits: `--zai --cached` used to print every cached provider; now subsets to the requested ones, and refetches if any requested provider is missing from cache
- Cached output is labeled with its age: oneline gets a `(cached 42s)` suffix, detailed header gets `(cached 42s ago)` — via `read_cache()` now returning `(data, age_seconds)` and new `format_cache_age()`
- Z.AI `token_quota` no longer emits fake `limit/used/remaining: 0` — the `/quota/limit` TOKENS_LIMIT entry only carries `percentage` + `nextResetTime` (verified against raw API); counts included only when the API provides them. Also captures plan `level` (e.g. "max") into `plan`, rendered by the generic 📊 Plan line
- Z.AI total fetch failure (both endpoints + auth fallback down) now returns `error: "Could not fetch usage"` instead of a dict with neither status nor error (which oneline silently dropped)
- Tests: 147 passing (11 new across test_cli/test_usage/test_utils/test_output)

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_usage.py`, `tests/test_utils.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-07-02: Cache Merge + Missing-Credentials Icon

- `write_cache()` now merges into the existing cache via new `merge_cache_data()`: a provider entry with `error: "No credentials found"` no longer overwrites a previous good entry, and partial runs (e.g. `--zai`) no longer clobber other providers' cached data
- Rationale: cache is shared across environments (cron/statusline vs interactive shell); a run missing `ZAI_API_KEY` was poisoning the cache, making `--oneline --cached` show `Z.AI: ❌` while a direct probe was healthy
- `--oneline` now renders missing credentials as 🔑 (`no key` in yellow with `--noemoji`) instead of ❌, distinguishing config issues from API outages; matched on the exact `NO_CREDS_ERROR = "No credentials found"` string all providers use
- Added tests: `TestMergeCacheData` (test_utils.py), `TestOnelineMissingCredentials` (test_output.py); suite now 136 passing

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/test_utils.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-06-27: Synthetic.new Provider

- Added Synthetic.new support via `--synthetic` (env: `SYNTHETIC_API_KEY` / `SYNTHETIC_KEY`)
- Hits `GET https://api.synthetic.new/v2/quotas` (Bearer auth) — `/quotas` requests don't count against the subscription
- Exposes all three primary buckets: `daily_subscription` (period requests), `rolling_5h` (5h token tick), `weekly_credits` (USD credits with regen tick)
- One-line mapping: `5h` → rolling 5h used %, `7d` → weekly credit used %, `both` → `5h%/7d%`
- Added timezone-aware `_format_resets_in()` helper (Python 3.9 fromisoformat-compatible) for ISO-8601 `Z` timestamps
- Updated detailed/oneline/JSON paths plus README, CLAUDE.md endpoints table, and credential discovery section

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-06-26: Python 3.9+ Compatibility (PR #1)

- Merged PR #1 from @Elyter: added `from __future__ import annotations` to defer evaluation of PEP 604 `X | None` unions
- Bumped stated minimum from Python 3.10+ → 3.9+ across README, `bin/cclimits.js` error message, CLAUDE.md, and memory-bank files
- Verified no `match` statements remain in `lib/cclimits.py`, so the `__future__` import is sufficient for 3.9 support
- Released as 1.2.13

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `README.md`, `bin/cclimits.js`, `CLAUDE.md`, `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`, `memory-bank/techContext.md`

## 2026-06-15: Antigravity Oneline Usage Normalization

- Added oneline regression coverage and updated README examples
- Fixed full test-suite isolation for module patching, cache writes, urllib fallback tests, and minimal detailed-output fixtures

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`, `tests/test_credentials.py`, `tests/test_http.py`, `tests/test_output.py`, `README.md`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`, `memory-bank/progress.md`

## 2026-05-31: Antigravity Live Test + File-Based Credential Discovery

- Verified end-to-end against a real `agy` install — returned 20 models, project ID, free-tier
- Discovered the real credential file: `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token` (nested `{"token": {...}}` shape, RFC3339 expiry)
- Replaced keyring-probing with file-based discovery (kept env-var fallback unchanged)
- Fixed `--oneline` status icon: now passes `100 - min_remaining_pct` so 100% remaining renders ✅, not ❌
- Closes #2

**Files:** `lib/cclimits.py`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `memory-bank/deltas.md`

## 2026-05-30: Google Antigravity Provider (initial)

- Added Google Antigravity support via `--antigravity` with Cloud Code Assist `:loadCodeAssist` + `:fetchAvailableModels`

  - 013: Replit (high - GraphQL credits API)
  - 014: Windsurf/Codeium (medium - config discovery)
  - 015: Amazon Q (medium - AWS CLI research needed)
- Top candidates: Replit (clearest API), GitHub Copilot (largest user base)
